ðŸ’§ Water Potability Detection â€“ Machine Learning Project
This project involves a machine learning model designed to predict whether water is drinkable based on various physical and chemical properties. It serves as an example for use in environmental analysis, public health, and automated decision support systems.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
To classify different water samples as drinkable or not drinkable based on their analytical data.
